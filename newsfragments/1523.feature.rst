Added the concept of a "scope variable" (`trio.lowlevel.ScopeVar`), which is
like a context variable except that its value in a new task is determined
differently. A context variable is inherited by a new task based on its value
at the location where the task was spawned, while a scope variable is inherited
based on its value where the task's parent nursery was opened. This distinction
makes scope variables useful for anything that's naturally inherited along
parent/child task relationships.
