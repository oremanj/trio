On Windows, Trio now works around the buggy behavior of certain
Layered Service Providers (system components that can intercept
network activity) that are built on top of a commercially available
library called Komodia Redirector. This benefits users of products
such as Astrill VPN and Qustodio parental controls. Previously, Trio
would crash on startup when run on a system where such a product was
installed.
