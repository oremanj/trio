Trio now supports automatic :ref:`async generator finalization
<async-generators>`, so more async generators will work even if you
don't wrap them in ``async with async_generator.aclosing():``
blocks. Please see the documentation for important caveats; in
particular, yielding within a nursery or cancel scope remains
unsupported.
