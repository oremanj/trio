When using :ref:`instruments <instrumentation>`, you now only "pay for what you use":
if there are no instruments installed that override a particular hook such as
:meth:`~trio.abc.Instrument.before_task_step`, then Trio doesn't waste any effort
on checking its instruments when the event corresponding to that hook occurs.
Previously, installing any instrument would incur all the instrumentation overhead,
even for hooks no one was interested in.
